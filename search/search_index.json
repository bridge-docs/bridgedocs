Cookies \u00b6 Most web browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. Users can reset their web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Please note, however, that certain features of the site might not function if you delete or disable cookies.

Security \u00b6 We would like to assure our users that the company will use the necessary measures to protect the security of your data. However, it is impossible for the company to completely guarantee that user data will be immune from malicious attack or compromise; as such, users should understand that transmission of personal data is always at their own risk.
