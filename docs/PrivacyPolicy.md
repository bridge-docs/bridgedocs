## User Safekeeping of Personal Data

Bridge would like to remind users to carefully protect the personal information that they submit on the site — including their passwords, usernames, location, images, and videos — so that other parties can&#39;t manipulate their accounts or assume their identities.

## Changes to the Privacy Policy

Our company may make changes to its privacy policy from time-to-time. Users should periodically revisit the policy for any updates. The company will also make an effort to notify its users of any policy changes, and require that users acknowledge updates by checking a box or pressing a button. Users who continue to interact with the site following a revision of the company&#39;s privacy policy will automatically be subject to the new terms.
